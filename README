1. What is hashkill?
====================

hashkill (stupid name I know) is an open-source password cracker that uses the OpenSSL library to 
crack different types of password hashes.

Basically, its purposes are:

* allow cracking lots of different types of password hashes on linux
* employ easy to use command-line interface
* multithreaded
* SSE2/XOP accelerated
* GPU accelerated
* open-sourced, GPL-licensed

Disadvantages at that moment are that it does not support GPU-based cracking. 



2. Installation
===============

Everything boils down to installing the package prerequisites, ./configure && make && make install.

Useful options to configure are:

--datadir : the directory where all plugins, kernels, markov models and preinstalled rulesets will be placed
--bindir  : location of the hashkill binary

Build prerequisites:

* gcc >=4.6
* libc headers
* json-c (also known as libjson0) and its headers for session save/restore support
* proprietary AMD/NVidia drivers for GPU support and kernel compilation
* zlib and its headers
* openssl and its headers
* pkgconfig
* libtool
* make



3. Features
===========

Currently (0.2.4) hashkill supports 4 attack modes:

* Markov attack (default)
* bruteforce
* rule

hashkill supports sessions (e.g interrupted session can be restored)

Currently there are 41 plugins that can crack more than 45 different hash types.

And lots of bugs I guess :)
